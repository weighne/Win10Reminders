--Windows 10 Reminders--

Created by weighne

Pretty straightforward piece of code. 
Using win10toast this will create a litle popup in the Windows 10 notification 
area at the desired time, with the desired message.

The program prompts you for a time and a message, during this it is constantly 
checking the current time in the background. Once the current time matches the 
input time, a notificaion pops up and displays the text entered. 

The final product will (hopefully) support multiple reminders throughout the day 
and (potentially) an option to plan reminders days in advance.
